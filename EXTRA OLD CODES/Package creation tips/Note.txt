This examples demonstrates how to import your own modules or the folders with modules in it
before the other packages, if there is another built in or site libraries with SAME NAMES.

1. if you have a folder, change it to a package by empty content __init__.py file to 
put it high on priority (package and modules are on same priority but folder is on lower priority)

2. Your modules or packages name SHOULD NOT be built in standrad packages name, 
BUILD IN packages are on the HIGHEST priority (pyautogui ok,time not ok)

3. Once your own modules or packages is imported, it can contain fuctions(in your modules)
or modules(in your packages) with built in package's name(like time) without any problem.
