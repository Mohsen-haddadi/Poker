Functions with True or False return,are in 2 kind of categoreis: 1.Me_Flush_ Me_Flush_draw 2.Table_Flush Table_Flush_draw
If one of them is True the rest will be False. All functions can be False at the same time.

Ranking Functions are :1.Me_flush_Ranking 2.Me_flush_draw_Ranking .
Ranking Functions return 1.a Number or 2.None value if their True or False Functions have not been True already.
Table functions has no rankings in Flush and Pair files. in Str file there are Table_.._Number functions.
