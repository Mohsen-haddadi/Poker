1. Cross file global varibales should be origanated at config.py 
   and can be declared at both in:
    1. at config.py file
       (this is my choise for creating this package)
    2. at other files: but still the variable origin should refer to config.py 
       by using config.var.
       (Example: at main.py or other files: config.var = 1)
       Otherwise:
          If they are origanated and declared at main.py (like var = 0) and 
          updated at other files and then printed at main.py, they will not updated.
       (this route will bring circular imports problems too)

2. Cross file global variables can be modified and updated both in:
    1. at config.py file: by using global line at functions
       (this is my choise for creating this package)
    2. at other files: without even using global line
       ;even if you assign them in a function; by using config.var
       (use config.var instead of var to avoid assigning errors
        (use import config instead of from config import var))

**I use routes 1.1 and 2.1**
